Revision history for autopackage

        * Practical rewrite by Toby Inkster <tobyink@cpan.org>
          getting rid of Filter::Simple, but adding a few new
          deps.  Since Filter::Simple isn't going to continue to
          be in future revisions of Perl (at this point it's
          marked for removal from core), and someone has volunteered
          code to get rid of it, I had to take it.
        * Fix @INC limitation, again by Toby Inkster <tobyink@cpan.org>

0.001   2012-06-08
        * First release.
